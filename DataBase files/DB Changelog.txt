DB structure changelog

15 Mar 2017:

- fixed buildTables.sql, removeAllTables.sql



14 Mar 2017:

User Profile
- changed Users table to reflect google sign in  and interface changes. 
	- added google_id - : this is currently stored as VARCHAR(21) because google ids are too long to store as a BIGINT. You'll need to convert this when adding and pulling it from the database. Since this is problematic (and using google_id for everything is a little sketchy imo), i'm keeping user_id for our backend.
	- added box_id - need to know the type specifics for this.
	- added phone_number - currently 11 digits. Let me know if we want options for international phone numbers (probably not)
Let me know what we want for the final user profile details, and whether or not the info from google sign in should be stored on our side.
	- I still have slots for a user, first and last name. let me know how nessecary this is.
	- added a slot for profile image url. Let me know if we're going to store any of this on our side or use google sign in every time.
	- removed password, use credentials from google sign in.

Image Files (profile)
- removed completely, retrieve profile image from google sign in

Group Profile
- removed number_of_admins, do through query instead.
- added group_description if we really want it.

Chat
- Chat table and chat_id was removed, use group_id as the key for Chat_Messges instead.

Calendar
- Calendar structure was changed so that the personal and group messges are now split into separate tables.  This was because having a calendar_id with 2 id's attatched to it was problematic and would have caused bloat down the line.
- the Calendar table and calendar_id was removed, do event searches through the user_id and group_id.

note on google_id
I'll also need to know if this is going to be nessecary for the box id as well (or how the file API works in general.)
